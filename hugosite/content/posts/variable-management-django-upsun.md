## Why Upsun for Django?

[Upsun](https://upsun.com) stands out as a comprehensive platform for Django developers that addresses many common pain points in Django deployment and development.

- Ready-to-use services: [Redis, PostgreSQL](https://robertdouglass.github.io/on_upsun/posts/install-django-postgresql-pgvector-upsun/), Kafka, Elastic Search, Open Search and more
- Environment cloning for testing and development (great for teams working together)
- Infrastructure-as-code for version-controlled server setups
- [Local development boost through service tunneling](https://robertdouglass.github.io/on_upsun/posts/develop-locally-django-postgresql-redis-upsun/)
- Integrated [Blackfire profiling](https://blog.blackfire.io/understanding-monitoring-traces-extended-traces-and-profiles.html) for performance optimization

These features collectively create an ecosystem that streamlines Django development, from local coding to production deployment.

## The Importance of Variable Management

While Upsun's features are powerful, their effective use hinges on mastering variable management. Proper variable handling is crucial because it:
- Prevents security breaches by keeping sensitive information out of your codebase
- Maintains environment integrity, ensuring development doesn't interfere with production
- Clarifies system architecture, making your project more maintainable
- Reduces debugging time by minimizing configuration-related issues

Consider this example of secure variable usage:
```python
# Insecure
SECRET_KEY = "actual_secret_key_here"  # Exposed in code

# Secure
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("DJANGO_SECRET_KEY")  # Secured in environment
```

## Understanding Upsun's Variable System

Upsun employs a hierarchical variable system that offers flexibility and security across different project scopes. Understanding this system is key to leveraging Upsun's full potential.

Upsun uses three types of variables:
1. Project variables: Apply across all environments in a project
2. Environment variables: Specific to individual environments (e.g., development, staging, production)
3. Application variables: Defined in `.upsun/config.yaml`, specific to each application

These variables follow a precedence order: Environment > Project > Application. This hierarchy allows for fine-grained control over your configuration.

For example, you might set a default DEBUG value in your application variables:
```yaml
# .upsun/config.yaml
applications:
    myapp:
        variables:
            env:
                DEBUG: false
```
But then override it for a specific environment using the Upsun console or CLI.

Upsun also provides `PLATFORM_*` variables that give you insights into your runtime environment. These are particularly useful for dynamic configuration:

```python
import json
import base64

relationships = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.environ['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']))
db_settings = relationships['database'][0]

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': db_settings['path'],
        'USER': db_settings['username'],
        'PASSWORD': db_settings['password'],
        'HOST': db_settings['host'],
        'PORT': db_settings['port'],
    }
}
```

This setup automatically configures your database connection based on the current environment, eliminating the need for manual configuration across different deployments. You will see similar code in the `settings_psh.py` file that gets generated by the `upsun project:init` command. [See this example](https://github.com/robertDouglass/on_upsun/blob/main/02_install_django_postgresql_pgvector_upsun/myproject/myproject/settings_psh.py). 

## Managing Sensitive Data: OPENAI_API_KEY

Handling sensitive data, like API keys, requires extra care. Let's use the OPENAI_API_KEY as an example to illustrate best practices across different environments.

1. Local Development:
   Create a `.env` file (remember to add it to `.gitignore`):
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Then in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
   ```

   This approach keeps your key secure during local development.

2. Upsun Environments:
   Use the Upsun CLI to securely set the variable:
   ```
   upsun variable:create --level environment --name OPENAI_API_KEY --value your_api_key
   ```

   This command sets the variable for a specific environment, allowing you to use different keys for staging and production.

3. Accessing in Django:
   ```python
   from django.conf import settings
   import openai

   openai.api_key = settings.OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

   By accessing the key through settings, you maintain a consistent interface regardless of where the key is stored.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. Differentiate Environments:
   Use `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT` and `PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` to adjust settings based on the current environment:
   ```python
   import os

   env_name = os.getenv('PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT', 'local')
   env_type = os.getenv('PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'development')

   if env_type == 'production':
       DEBUG = False
       ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['www.example.com']
   elif env_type == 'staging':
       DEBUG = True
       ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['staging.example.com']
   else:
       DEBUG = True
       ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']

   # You can also use env_name for more specific environment handling
   if env_name == 'main':
       # Special configuration for the main environment
       pass
   ```

   This approach allows you to maintain a single settings file while still customizing behavior per environment type and name.

2. Use Upsun-provided variables:
   ```python
   import os
   import json
   import base64

   # Access the application configuration
   app_config = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.environ['PLATFORM_APPLICATION']).decode('utf-8'))

   # Use PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY for secret key
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ['PLATFORM_PROJECT_ENTROPY']

   # Set the static root using PLATFORM_APP_DIR
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(os.environ['PLATFORM_APP_DIR'], 'static')

   # Configure database using PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS
   if os.environ.get('PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS'):
       relationships = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.environ['PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS']).decode('utf-8'))
       db_settings = relationships['database'][0]
       DATABASES = {
           'default': {
               'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
               'NAME': db_settings['path'],
               'USER': db_settings['username'],
               'PASSWORD': db_settings['password'],
               'HOST': db_settings['host'],
               'PORT': db_settings['port'],
           }
       }
   ```
   This approach allows you to maintain a single settings file while still customizing behavior per environment type and name.

3. Handle Sensitive Data:
   For highly sensitive information, use Upsun's encrypted variables:
   ```
   upsun variable:create --level project --name SUPER_SECRET --value "sensitive_data" --sensitive true
   ```

   Access these variables through `PLATFORM_VARIABLES`:
   ```python
   import os
   import json
   import base64

   platform_vars = json.loads(base64.b64decode(os.environ['PLATFORM_VARIABLES']).decode('utf-8'))
   SUPER_SECRET = platform_vars.get('SUPER_SECRET')
   ```

4. Debug Variable Issues:
   * Always redeploy after changing variables:
     ```bash
     upsun redeploy
     ```
   * Use `upsun ssh` to check environment variables:
     ```bash
     $ upsun ssh
     $ env | grep PLATFORM
     PLATFORM_APP_DIR=/app
     PLATFORM_APPLICATION_NAME=myapp
     PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT=main
     PLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE=production
     ...

     $ echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
     sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456
     ```
     This allows you to verify the exact values of environment variables in your Upsun environment.
   * Review Upsun's activity log:
     ```bash
     $ upsun activity:list
     Activities on the project django_pycache_test (wj2ykkepeqdzu), environment main (type: production):
     +---------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+----------+----------+---------+
